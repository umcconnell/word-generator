## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need python3 with pip3 and jupyter installed on your machine. You can
install python from the official website https://www.python.org/.
Jupyter can be installed from the official website as well: https://jupyter.org/

### Initial setup

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a virtual python
environment running:

Clone the git repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/umcconnell/python-boilerplate-demo.git
```

And navigate into the folder

```bash
cd python-boilerplate-demo/
```

Finally, start the jupyter server and open the notebook in the `src/` folder:

```bash
jupyter lab
# or jupyter notebook depending on your installation
```
